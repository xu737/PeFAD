We conduct experiments on the hyperparameter sensitivity of ADMS and PPDS, the results on SMD dataset are as follows.

| ADMS ($\beta$) | AUC-ROC |
| --- | --- |
| 0.2 | 97.22 |
| 0.4 | 96.41 |
| 0.6 | 97.19 |
| 0.8 | 97.19 |

| PPDS ($\alpha_1,\alpha_2$) | AUC-ROC |
| --- | --- |
| (0.7, 0.3) | 97.22 |
| (0.6, 0.4) | 97.22 |
| (0.5, 0.5) | 97.16 |
| (0.4, 0.6) | 96.89 |
| (0.3, 0.7) | 96.55 |
| w/o_PPDS | 93.97 |
