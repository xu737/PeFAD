(1) The 4 datasets are widely used by existing works, sourced from diverse real-world domains, covering internet data (SMD), server operational data (PSM), infrastructure system (SWaT), and monitoring events (MSL).

(2) We have added a experiment on a new UCR Dataset (KDD21 cup) with 250 types of time series from various domains. The main results of F1-Score below indicates that PeFAD outperforms baselines by at least 22.8%.

The resut on UCR dataset is shown in below table:

|         | AUC   | F1-Score |
| ------- | ----- | -------- |
| AT      | 61.75 | 43.70    |
| FPT     | 63.64 | 50.12    |
| TimsNet | 64.69 | 52.42    |
| PeFAD   | 87.45 | 79.07    |
